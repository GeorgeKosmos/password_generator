# Password Generator
The goal of the project is to create a simple (for now) password generator.
<br><br>
So what it is a password generator? simply is a program that generates passwords (yes you couldn't figure out that by yourself...).
Now the interesting thing about why we need a password generator is also simple, the end users very often (almost always) dont know about basic password security.
<br><br>
A secure password should abide with the following rules:
- The password should be long enough in order to be hard to be guessed.
- The password should not contain anything personal that it is easy to guess (E.g. your dog's name or your birthday).
- The password should only be used once.
- The password should contain random characters or atleast very hard to guess combination of characters.

## Features to implement
The program must support the following features:
- The user should be able to request an arbitrary number of passwords to be generated.
- The user should be able to request a minimum and a maximum length of the generated password(s).
- The user should be able to request to save the password(s) in a file at a user specified location.
- In case the user has not specified any of the above the program should follow some default behavior (think of one).
- The program should perform proper error handling.
- Error messages should be descriptive.
- The program should implement an cli (Command Line Interface, i.e. terminal)

## Rules
- The program **must** be written in Python.
- You are free to write your program as you like, but you must include the features described above.<br>
	<sub>(*failure to do so may result in death penalty... jk*)</sub>
- Have fun.

## Notes
- If you haven't install python already you can get it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Feel free to add more features.
- Think of any security vulnerability and fix them.
- And **the most important:** you are a programmer, use a search engine (E.g. google, bing). You dont know everything and you need to learn by your self, its part of the process.
  If you have any question use the following method. Lets say you dont know how to generate random numbers in python, open a web browser (E.g. firefox, chrome) and in the google
  search bar type the following: *python how to create random numbers*. You will get many results pick one and read it, did it solve your problem? no? try a
  different result or ask a new similarly structured question.

## Submiting
When you finish the program send it to johnghd51@gmail.com. If you program is splitted in multiple files, archive them (i.e. zip, tar).
